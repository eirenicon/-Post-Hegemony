# Post-Hegemony

> This repository is part of the Ardens initiative. It will house resources for analyzing, deconstructing, and exposing the narratives, euphemisms, and rhetorical strategies used to justify or obscure hegemonic power.

## Planned Content

- **Rhetoric of Empire Lexicon**: A curated glossary mapping official language (e.g. "surgical strike", "defensive posture") to real-world impact.
- **Media and Discourse Analysis**: Annotated examples of language in use—news articles, government statements, and NGO reports.
- **Counter-Narratives**: Alternative framings and reclaimed language intended to restore clarity and agency.

## Status

Repository initialized as part of the Ardens roadmap. Full content is forthcoming.
